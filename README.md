# mac-name

## Synopsis

Three variation scripts that set LocalHost and HostName efficiently.

## Summary

Set from a CSV, set from a Prefix/Suffix configuration, set equal to the serial
number.

## Workflow

Each script has two key markings:

`# --- testing only (comment-out in production) --- #`
`# --- system wide changes below! (enable when ready) --- #`

System wide changes are commented out by default, while testing lines are enabled.
